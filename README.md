# alon:lag-base

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MasterAM/meteor-lag-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MasterAM/meteor-lag-base)

A highly configurable Meteor package that provides the base for packages that add delay to publications and method calls on your development machine.

Those also have a [Constellation UI plugin](https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-console) to easily configure its defived packages, [`alon:lag-methods`] and [`alon:lag-publications`].

**Note**: This is only a base package. Use either of the aforementioned packages in order to get the actual functionality that you desire.

## Installation

```sh
$ meteor add alon:lag-base
```
**Note**: This package is not meant to be installed directly. Use one of the dependent packages.

## TL;DR
Those packages (this one is just the base for them) allow you to delay publications and method calls on your dev machine so that you don't have to use stuff like `Meteor._sleepForMs()` in code that should be commit-able, in order to simulate network lag.

You can configure it to only delay certain publications for the amount of time you choose.

It is recommended to use [lag-console] in order to control it.

## Introduction
Since development is often done on a powerful local machine without much load, publication data are usually ready almost straight away. Any UI changes that reflect the intermediate state often appear as a short flash of content before the view renders with the new data or state.

This behavior is different from the one that will be experienced by users of the production server, and therefore developers sometimes resort to quick and dirty ways for adding delay to their publications (by calling `Meteor._sleepForMs()` - or dirtier solutions - directly in publication code). If left alone and not cleaned up, it could eventually cause undesired delay of the deployed application.

This package is intended to provide a cleaner alternative to those dirty fixes.

The package adds delay to publications on the server only. Different delays can be configured for specific publications and the default delay can also be set (it is 1000 ms by default).

A [Constellation] plugin called [lag-console] was created in order to control it with more ease.

## Usage
The package can be configured via a settings file or by calling its API configuration methods.
### settings file
This is probably the cleanest way to use the package.

This package uses the `lagMethods` property of the configuration file.

#### options

All settings are **optional**.

All publications wll have `defaultDelay`, except for the ones that are explicitly set in `publications`, or the ones that are `exclude`d.

```json
{
  "lagConfig": {
    "base": {
      "disable": "<Boolean, default: false>",
      "persist": "<Boolean, default: false>",
      "defaultDelay": "<Integer, default: 2000>",
      "usePredefinedExcludes": "<Boolean, default: true>",
      "log": "<Boolean, default: false>",
      "unblock": "<Boolean, default: true>"
    }
  }
}
```
**disable**: `Boolean`

If set to `true`, the package is deactivated.

This setting is `false` by default.

**persist**: `Boolean`

If set to true, the publication delays and other settings will be saved in a Mongo collection on the server and changes to them will persist across server restarts.

In this case, all options will be set only during the first time the server starts after this option is set to `true` and all other settings (except `disable`) will be ignored in subsequent restarts.

You can use the API method `setConfigOptions(configs)` (explained later) to change them later.

This setting is `false` by default.

**defaultDelay**: `Integer`

If set, it will be the default delay for publications without specific settings.

**usePredefinedExcludes**: `Boolean`

The package contains a built-in list of publication names that should probably not be delayed even when the package is active.

Those publications are generally related to testing and other aspects that do not affect user experience and can have adverse effects if delayed (such as slowing down test runs).

If set to `true`, those publications will not be delayed.

This setting is `true` by default.

**log**: `Boolean`

If set to `true`, the package logs all of the publication invocations (via subscriptions).

This can help you track the server calls temporarily or figure out which publications to delay/exclude.

This setting is `false` by default.

**unblock**: `Boolean`

If set to `true`, `this.unblock()` is called before setting the delay, so publications can run in parallel.

This setting is `true` by default.

### API for the base package
The delays and other options can be set dynamically by calling the API configuration functions available on the server.

Since this package is a `devOnly` package, it does not create any top-level global variable, so the API is available via the `Package` global object:
```js
Package['alon:lag-base'].API
```

The following examples use the shorthand `api` instead:

```js
var api = Package['alon:lag-base'].API;
```

It has the following methods:

### getDefaultDelay()

Gets the current default delay

**Returns**: `Number`, current delay, in ms

### setDefaultDelay(delay)

Set the default delay for publications.

**Parameters**

**delay**: `Number`, the default delay to set (in ms)

**Returns**: `Number`, the previous delay value

**Example**:
```js
//sets the default delay to 1500 ms
api.setDefaultDelay(1500);
```

### getDelayFor(type, name)

Get the delay for a given target name (or the default delay if it is not explicitly set).

**Parameters**

**type**: `String`, the type of target (publication/method)

**name**: `String`, the target name

**Returns**: `Number`, the delay, in ms

### setDelaysFor(type, delays)

Set the delays for specific publications.
Specify the delays in an object which keys are publication names:

**Parameters**

**type**: `String`, the target type

**delays**: `Object`, a key-value collection of publication names and delays


**Example**:
```js
api.setDelaysFor('publication', {
  'baz': 1500,
  ...
});
```

### setExclude(type, names, doExclude)

Set the delays for specific targets.
Specify the delays in an object which keys are publication names:

**Parameters**

**type**: `String`, the target type

**names**: `Array`, an array of publication names

**doExclude**: `Boolean`, whether or not to replace exclude given publications


**Example**:
```js
// prevent delay for publications 'foo' and 'bar'
api.setExclude('publication', [
  'foo',
  'bar'
], true);
```

### setConfigOptions(configs)

Sets the config options to those specified.

**Parameters**

**configs**: `Object`, a configuration object, as the one in the json config file


**Example**:
```js
// set multiple config basic config options
api.setConfigOptions({
  "disable": false,
  "defaultDelay": 450,
  "log": true,
  "unblock": true
});
```

## Running tests

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MasterAM/meteor-lag-base.git
$ cd meteor-lag-base
$ meteor test-packages ./
```
and pointing your browser to the relevant URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
